## Setup

### GCP
In order to connect to your GCP Storage bucket, enter the bucket name in `appsettings.json` file:

```
  "Cloud": {
    "Storage": {
      "BucketName": "my-bucket-name"
    }
  }
```

If you run this service inside GCP, you don't need to authenticate. Otherwise, download the service account JSON file and setup the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env variable to refer to the JSON. See more [here](https://cloud.google.com/dotnet/docs/reference/Google.Cloud.Storage.V1/latest#authentication).

### Microsoft Identity Platform
1. To use Microsoft Identity Platform, create your Azure Active Directory tenant:
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)

2. Register the service with Microsoft Identity Platform:
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)

3. Expose scopes:
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis)

4. Grant scoped permissions to web API:
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis)

Make sure you add the `instance`, `domain`, `tenantId`, `clientId` and `scopes` to the service's config file or via environme variables.
